A software engineer died after falling from the sixth floor of his office building on July 4 but no concrete conclusion about the cause of his death has been reached yet. Dharmendra Lodha, 25, was working with Accenture, in their office located in building number 2 of Mindspace in Airoli for the last two-and-a-half years. The incident occurred around 3 am on July 4 when he fell off the building under mysterious circumstances. Doctors at Chhatrapati Shivaji hospital in Kalva declared him dead around 3.50 am.\r\n\r\n\r\nCops Suspect Suicide\r\n\r\nInvestigating officer Anil Patil told mid-day that the police had spoken to around four to five of Lodha's colleagues who told them that he had invested lakhs of rupees somewhere and had suffered losses in those deals. \"He was under depression for around three months owing to this. These statements point to him committing suicide,\" Patil said. \"However, we have sent his mobile phone to the Kalina FSL for a detailed analysis and are also waiting for his post-mortem analysis report. We have written to the bank for his account details to get a clearer picture,\" Patil added. \"We also scanned the CCTV footage which does not show any suspicious activity,\" he added.\r\n\r\nFamily Denies Suicide\r\n\r\nDharmendra's elder brother, Daulat Singh Lodha, said, \"I know my brother had invested around Rs 2.5 lakh in Q-Net but he was not in depression at all. I always asked him to invest his hard-earned money somewhere and a few weeks ago he had transferred Rs 1.5 lakh into my account asking me to invest them for him. We were like best friends and he used to tell me everything about his life. He never sounded like he was upset or under depression.\" The family is unwilling to accept the premise of his probable suicide. \"If he had money to invest, why would he commit suicide for just Rs 2.5 lakh?\" his brother wondered, adding that their parents (from Madhya Pradesh) were on their way to Mumbai when the incident took place.", "url": null, "url2": "https://www.mid-day.com/articles/airoli-accident-not-a-suicide-says-family-of-man-who-fell-off-office-building/21450180", "image": "home/news/2019/08/family-suicide_d.jpg"}}, {"model": "home.news", "pk": 6, "fields": {"category": 6, "user": 2, "date": "2019-08-03", "heading": "Mumbai climate", "description": "Mumbai climate is really horrible during monsoons for working employee's.

The secret is don't eat anything before journey, during journey. If you are hungry take fluids.\r\n\r\nIf you are on low budget, I would recommend to reach Govind ghat on the same day, as you can stay at Gurudwara in Govind ghat for free. Next day hike to Ghangria from Govindghat(13km).\r\n\r\nThe hike is easy, through the forests and there are so many rest points , shops and bathrooms. So don't worry about food.\r\nIt took me six hours to reach Ghangria. Ghangria is a small town which acts as a junction point to Hemkund and valley of flowers. It is 13km from Govind Ghat.In Ghangria, I stayed in Gurudwara  as it is free and really the best place to stay. if you want to book a room prefer GMVN guest houses, other private rooms are very costly and the facility is also not that good.
